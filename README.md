CSV parser 

Create a new project to read structured and unstructured data

1. So my plan of attack is to Create a csv file reader that summarize the data 

2. Then create a streamlit website GUI for it 

3. After that add on unstructed data analyzer in the tools which I assume the file to be in a pdf form.
